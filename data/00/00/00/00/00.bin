  |   Update/Patch Notes: v1.0.1 (v65536)                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Fixed an issue with the Affinity Chart, in which completing it      |
  |     did not cause Trust to become S rank, and the completion reward     |
  |     item was subsequently not earned.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - After downloading the update, checking the Affinity Chart again     |
  |     will cause Trust to increase to S rank and give the player the      |
  |     completion reward item.                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Fixed an issue with the third requirement to "Meet characters       |
  |     from the Community List" for receiving Jin’s Affinity Reward,       |
  |     "Mineralogy." This issue prevented characters that had been met     |
  |     in event scenes or cut scenes to not be counted as "met" unless     |
  |     the player talked to them outside those scenes.                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |     - This applied to the characters Popolo, Onyx, Kaleena, and Leo.    |
  |     - After downloading the update, if you have already viewed the      |
  |       necessary event or cut scenes, these characters will              |
  |       automatically be counted as "met."                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Added a help message to the quest "A Rare Sense of Justice" that    |
  |     will appear when conditions to advance the quest have not been      |
  |     met.                                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Fixed an issue when performing a Chain Attack that temporarily      |
  |     prevented character selection after a "round" of attacks had        |
  |     been completed.                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Fixed an issue causing a character switch to take too long when     |
  |     selecting Brighid for a Chain Attack after she had used her         |
  |     Confining Flames ability.                                           |
  |                                                                         |
